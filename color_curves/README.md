This straightforward Matlab project computes and plots the CIE color matching functions. 
The functions x(wave), y(wave), and z(wave) serve as numerical descriptions of 
the chromatic response of the observer. The chromatic response is computed with a 1-nanometer step.

Two types of observers are used to compute the chromatic response:
1) 2 degrees 1931  : xyz_curves_1931.m
2) 10 degrees 1964 : xyz_curves_1964.m
